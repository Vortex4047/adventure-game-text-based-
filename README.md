# adventure-game-text-based-
This is a text-based adventure game in Python that involves MySQL database features for the management of player profiles and game states. In this game, the user will be transported to a fantasy world where he/she is able to travel to different places, overcome different challenges, and make a lot of choices that will influence the development of his/her progress.

## Key Features:

1. **Database Integration:**
- It uses a MySQL database for the persistent storage of player profiles and game data. This allows a new player profile to be created, or an old one loaded, into and managed—in terms of listing or deleting—through the game interface.

2. **Dynamic Game World:**
A variety of locations are available in the game world, each with its own text description and some actions potentially available. The locations include a village, forest, cave, and castle. The player can walk through these locations by selecting options from the menu of available actions.

3. **Random Events:**
Level events and situations are inserted to avoid monotony of gameplay. For example, a player might meet a friendly creature in the forest or find hidden treasure and other useful resources in a cave. These add a notion of randomness within the game.

4. Character Management:
- Each player, at the beginning of the game, has a profile representing information for his or her player character in the game, like his name. Some of the attributes for this character could be health, maximum health, attack power, level, experience, and score. These attributes may evolve in the course of the game as the player progresses through challenges.

5. **Gameplay Mechanics:**
The game offers the player choices at every location. Again, how things unfold depends on both the location and the choice. It may be some item found, experience gained, or enemies met. For example, in the forest, he could look for herbs, climb a tree, or go back to the village.
- The game loop is responsible for the progress that will be made in a player's journey through a game world. The player provides textual input to move between places, execute actions, and drive decisions.

6. **Save and Load Game Functionality:**
- Players can save their game progress, including their current location and character attributes, at any point. This will allow them to come back at a later time and pick up where they last saved it. The `save_game` function writes the current state of the player to the database, and the `load_game` function picks it up when they come back.

7. **Profile Management:**
- It supports a simple profile management system through which all the existing profiles can be viewed, the profiles that are no longer needed can be deleted, and switching between different profiles is supported. That makes it easy for many players to use the same game instance.

8. **Menu-Driven Interface:**
The game runs through a menu-driven interface; what to do in each step of the game is clearly shown. This includes options for a new game, to load an existing game, manage profiles, and quit the game. All these make the game very approachable and easy to navigate.

#Structure:

- **Initialization:**
- The program starts with connecting to the MySQL database. If something goes wrong, then the program ends with an error message. Provided that a connection is successfully established, the script further proceeds to test whether the required database and table exist or not. In case they do not, it creates them.

 
- **Game Loop:**
The `start_menu` function is the main game loop that displays options to the user to start a new game, load a saved game, manage profiles, or quit. The response of the player will determine how the game should branch to either create a new profile, load an existing profile, or manage profiles.

- **Exploring Locations:**
Now that the player is in the game, they start in a village. Options are given to the player to visit various places, like a forest, a cave, or a castle. All of these are defined in the `locations` dictionary with their corresponding player actions. 

- **Player Actions:**
Options at each location include further exploration, investigating something in particular, or returning to the village. Outcomes of these actions are determined by corresponding functions, such as `explore_forest` or `enter_cave`, which include random events to add some replayability.

# Development Considerations:

- **Expandability:**
- This game is designed to be expandable. More locations, actions, and random events can easily be added by a developer. The `locations` dictionary is central to this, where new locations can be defined, and their corresponding actions mapped.

- **Error Handling:**
The script does basic error handling, especially in database operations. An example is that upon game loading and the failure to find the player's data, the game returns to a safe state.

- **Persistence of Data:**
  - With the help of a MySQL database, this game has its players' progress saved between sessions. This makes this game pretty robust as compared to purely memory-based games.

This program thus forms the ideal foundation of a text-based adventure game with many further enhancement possibilities. Such enhancements might include combat systems, more complex quests, or even multiplayer functionality.
